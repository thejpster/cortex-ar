# Arm Cortex-R Run-Time

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.82.0 and up, as recorded
by the `package.rust-version` property in `Cargo.toml`.

Increasing the MSRV is not considered a breaking change and may occur in a
minor version release (e.g. from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1`, because this is still a
`0.x` release).
